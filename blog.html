            <h3>Defining Technical Communication</h3>
            <p>
              If I were to explain technical communication to a colleague, I'd say it's the process of making complex
              information clear, concise, and easy for a specific audience to use. It’s not just about writing manuals;
              it's about creating any communication—be it an email, a presentation, or a webpage—that helps people
              understand a topic, complete a task, or make a decision. My background in computer science has shown me
              this firsthand. Explaining a software architecture to both project managers and other engineers requires
              tailoring the same core information for different audiences. This aligns with the chapter's definition,
              which describes technical communication as a set of activities people do to "discover, shape, and transmit
              information." It's the bridge between the expert and the person who needs to use that expert's knowledge.

            <h3>An Example of Effective Technical Communication</h3>
            <p>
              An excellent example of effective technical communication is the "Symptoms of a Heart Attack" infographic
              from the American Heart Association. As a former volunteer EMT, I saw how critical clear communication is
              in high-stakes situations. This infographic, while it may seem like a simple health poster, is a powerful
              piece of technical communication designed to convey vital information quickly and effectively when every
              second counts.
            </p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This infographic excels when measured against several of the "Measures of Excellence" mentioned in the
              chapter:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> It uses simple language ("Chest discomfort," "Shortness of breath") and
                clear icons. There's no jargon, which is crucial for a general audience with no medical training.</li>
              <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> In an emergency, no one has time to read a long document. This
                infographic presents the most vital information economically, getting the message across in seconds.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Usability:</strong> This is its strongest feature. The design is clean, the text is large, and
                the combination of words and images makes it highly accessible. It achieves its purpose—motivating a
                specific action (calling 911)—and meets the audience's needs in a critical moment.</li>
              <li><strong>Professional Appearance:</strong> The use of the American Heart Association's branding and a
                professional design lends it credibility, which makes the audience trust the information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Role of Technical Communication in My Future</h3>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I see technical communication playing a significant role in my career in computer science.
              The chapter's argument that employers highly value communication skills resonates with me. No matter how
              technical my work gets, I will always need to explain it to managers, team members, and clients who may
              not share my level of expertise. Being able to translate complex ideas into clear, actionable information
              will be essential for success. The principles of effective technical communication will be a constant in
              my professional life, and I believe my experiences as both a student of technology and a first responder
              have given me a unique appreciation for its importance. The chapter solidified my belief that strong
              communication isn't just a "soft skill" but a foundational and highly valuable professional tool.

            <h3>More Direction, Less Destination: Rethinking How I Set Goals</h3>
            <p>
              When listening to the podcast, something the host said just clicked. I know in the past I've definitely been guilty of setting "perfect" goals. The type that look great on paper (which is still specific, measurable, etc etc) but don't actually connect and are potentially too large for me too fulfill, and I got stuck. I was treating goal-setting like a to-do list instead of a tool for growth.

The idea that really stuck with me was making sure a goal is “directionally correct.” I don't need a perfect, five-year plan that predicts the future. I just need a pointer that helps me decide if an opportunity is a step in the right direction. It's a simple shift, but it's already helping me figure out ideas to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters, which is becoming the kind of engineer and researcher I want to be.

For example, I've been thinking about trying to use this pointer to guide my big decisions. Instead of just grabbing any internship, I should intentionally pursue roles in both product engineering and AI research. I wanted to test my own assumptions and figure out where I felt most energized before going all-in. My goals shouldn't be finish lines, but instead should be questions that help me decide what to do next. Should I spend this semester polishing a research paper, or should I go deeper into applied engineering? Framing it this way helps me avoid chasing empty wins.

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>
              So, what does this look like in practice right now? My one big goal for this semester is....
              <b>Overhaul my job portfolio (résumé, project write-ups, and GitHub) to tell a clear story about my skills in both AI research and applied engineering. Then apply for at least 30 competitive internships for Summer 2026.</b>

            <h3>How I'm staying on Track</h3>
            <p>
              A goal without a plan is just a wish. To make this happen, I'm using a simple digital roadmap (a Trello board synced with my Google Calendar) to break the project into milestones.
<ul>
  <li>Revise résumé</li>
  <li>Curate & write up top projects (with metrics!)</li>
  <li>Draft research statement</li>
  <li>Schedule feedback sessions with mentors</li>
</ul>

Seeing it all mapped out keeps me focused and prevents the "where do I even start?" paralysis. I hope this will help me stay accountable and make steady, directionally correct progress.

            <h3>Beyond the Deficit Model: Exploring Community Science and Empowerment</h3>
            <p>
              This week, we're diving into the world of community science, a topic that resonates deeply with me as a technical communicator. The recent readings on the Flint Water Crisis (Carrera & Key, 2021) and the ethics of science communication (Lunsford et al., 2025) have been particularly thought-provoking. They challenge us to move beyond simply disseminating information and to instead foster genuine collaboration and empowerment within our communities.

              To get a better sense of how these ideas play out in the real world, I decided to explore a community science project called "[The NOVA Energy Lab](https://scistarter.org/the-nova-energy-lab)" on SciStarter. This project, a collaboration between NOVA and the National Science Foundation, aims to engage the public in understanding and designing renewable energy systems. My experience with this project, viewed through the lens of our course readings, has been a fascinating case study in the opportunities and potential pitfalls of community-engaged science.

            <h3>Technical Communication in "The NOVA Energy Lab"</h3>
            <p>
              "The NOVA Energy Lab" is framed as a competitive game where participants design renewable energy systems for various US cities. The goal is to balance the demands of energy production with the constraints of available resources.

Here's my breakdown of their technical communication:

Effectiveness of Breakdown: The project's purpose and methods are communicated with a high degree of clarity and accessibility. The use of a competitive framework is a clever way to engage a broad audience and make complex concepts like energy conversion and resource scarcity more tangible. However, the breakdown of the underlying scientific concepts seems to be somewhat superficial. While the project is effective at teaching the what (e.g., that different energy sources have different trade-offs), it may be less effective at teaching the why (e.g., the complex physics behind solar panel efficiency).

Multimodal Communication: The project's page on SciStarter suggests a heavy reliance on multimodal communication, including videos and interactive graphics. This is a smart move, as it caters to different learning styles and can make abstract concepts more concrete. However, with the main NOVA Labs platform currently inaccessible, it's difficult to fully evaluate the effectiveness of these elements. Based on the project's description, it seems to make good use of multimodality to create an engaging user experience.

            <h3>Connecting to Theory: Empowerment or Deficit Model?</h3>
            <p>
              Now for the big question... how does this project connect to the ideas in the Carrera and Key (2021) article and the Lunsford et al. introduction from <em>Kairos</em>?

Empowerment: The Flint Water Crisis is a stark reminder of what happens when communities are disempowered and their voices are ignored. In Flint, it was community-led research that ultimately brought the crisis to light. In contrast, "The NOVA Energy Lab" seems to be more of a top-down educational tool than a platform for genuine community-based participatory research (CBPR). While it does a good job of educating participants about renewable energy, it's unclear whether it empowers them to take action or engage in local energy policy debates. The project teaches the science, but does it teach the advocacy?

The Deficit Model: The "deficit model" of science communication assumes that the public's skepticism towards science is due to a lack of knowledge, and that the solution is to simply provide more information. "The NOVA Energy Lab," with its focus on education and competition, risks operating from this model. It assumes that the primary barrier to the adoption of renewable energy is a lack of public understanding, rather than, say, a lack of political will or the influence of the fossil fuel industry. By framing the problem as a design challenge, the project may inadvertently downplay these larger systemic issues.

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
This exploration has given me a lot to think about as I move forward with my own projects. A few key takeaways I had are as follows.

<ol>
  <li>The way we frame a scientific or technical issue has a huge impact on how it's understood. "The NOVA Energy Lab" frames renewable energy as a fun design challenge, which is great for engagement but may obscure the political and economic dimensions of the problem. </li>
  <li>It's not enough to just give people the facts. We need to understand their values, their concerns, and their lived experiences. As the Lunsford et al. introduction argues, we need to move towards a more dialogic and participatory model of science communication.</li>
  <li> As technical communicators, we have a responsibility to not just inform but to empower. This means giving people the tools they need to engage in scientific and technical debates and to advocate for their own interests, as is illustrated in the story of Flint.</li>

              The middle layer—clarity, audience-centricity, and transparency—represents the essential principles of effective technical communication that bridge corporate intent and user understanding. When these principles are upheld through ethical communication, companies demonstrate honesty, competence, and respect for the user.

            <h3>Major Project 3</h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I want to build accessibility in from the start instead of adding it later as a fix. This means thinking about user needs right away rather than waiting for someone to point out a problem. As Lisa Pappas argues in <em>Rhetorical Accessability</em>, technical communicators should focus on how information is delivered, not just meeting legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              To apply this, I'll use the University of Washington's guide as a checklist while creating my project, keeping in mind that 20% of U.S. citizens have a disability. Here's what I'll do:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Describe Images:</strong> Every image, chart, or graph will have meaningful descriptions that explain what they show—not just generic labels. Decorative images will be marked so screen readers can skip them.</li>
              <li><strong>Tables for Data Only:</strong> I'll only use tables for actual data, with clear column and row labels. Tables won't be used just to arrange content visually.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <hr>

          <section>
            <h3>Example: Writing Good Alt Text</h3>
            <p>
              One key practice is writing clear descriptions for images and charts. Good descriptions let someone who can't see the image understand what it shows. Instead of just saying "bar chart," I should explain what the chart tells us.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>
              "A bar chart showing sources of website traffic. Organic Search is the top source at 45%, followed by Direct at 25%, Referral at 20%, and Social Media at 10%."
            </p>
            <p>
              This way, someone using a screen reader gets the same information as someone looking at the image.

            <h3>Making the Case for Accessibility at Work</h3>
            <p>
              In my future workplace, I'd explain that accessibility isn't extra work—it's part of doing good professional work.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Why does it matter?</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>It's Good for Business:</strong> Accessible design reaches more people and makes things easier for everyone. Companies like Fidelity Investments found that designing for accessibility builds customer loyalty. Plus, accessibility features often improve the mobile experience too.</li>
              <li><strong>It's Required by Law:</strong> The ADA and Section 508 require accessibility. Following these rules helps avoid lawsuits and supports employees who may develop disabilities over time.</li>
              <li><strong>It's the Right Thing to Do:</strong> As communicators, our job is to make sure people can understand our message. Everyone deserves access to information, and it's our responsibility to provide it—not wait for people to complain.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>How to get started:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use built-in tools:</strong> Programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat have accessibility checkers built in.</li>
              <li><strong>Make a quick checklist:</strong> Do headings create an outline? Does every image have a description? Are lists made with the list tool? Is the text easy to read?</li>
              <li><strong>Make it routine:</strong> Add accessibility checks to the normal editing process, just like spell-check. When it's part of the routine, it becomes a habit instead of an afterthought.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project: Personal Statement for the UIUC Center for Digital Agriculture (CDA) REU</h3>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Application for a Summer 2026 Research Experience for Undergraduates</p>

            <h3>The Pitch (Personal Statement Segment)</h3>
            <p>
              As a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics at Georgia Tech, my academic journey has been defined by a fascination with the mathematical foundations of intelligent systems. However, my work developing a bioinformatics tool at GeneSweeper and my recent research into 3D reconstruction has shifted my focus from purely theoretical algorithms to their application in complex, biological environments. I am drawn to the Center for Digital Agriculture (CDA) REU because it represents the convergence of my two strongest technical assets—computer vision and machine learning—with the critical, high-stakes domain of food security and environmental resilience. While I have spent the last three years mastering the syntax of code, I am eager to apply this fluency to the syntax of nature, specifically within the realms of plant phenotyping and autonomous agricultural robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
              My preparation for this interdisciplinary work is grounded in rigorous technical research. Currently, I am leading a project on 3D reconstruction using the CO3D v2 dataset, where I proposed Covisibility-Guided Sparse Attention to improve model fidelity. This experience in handling complex spatial data directly translates to the challenges of Computer Vision and Hyperspectral Imaging listed in the CDA tracks. Furthermore, my internship at GeneSweeper, where I built Python-based bioinformatics tools, gave me a functional understanding of genomic data structures. When combined with my experience designing a 3D-printed prosthetic arm, I possess a unique triad of skills—computer vision, biological data analysis, and robotics hardware—that are essential for developing next-generation agricultural technologies, such as autonomous harvesters or high-throughput phenotyping systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participating in the UIUC CDA REU is the necessary next step to bridge the gap between my current educational program and my professional goals. While Georgia Tech provides world-class instruction in the theory of Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning, I lack access to the Human-Technology-Animal/Plant Interfaces that the CDA specializes in. I am specifically interested in exploring how Multimodal Large Language Models can be adapted for precision agriculture—for example, processing visual sensor data from fields to provide real-time agronomic advice. This program would allow me to move beyond standard benchmarks like CodeELO and TQA-Bench and test AI systems against the unpredictable, noisy reality of the natural world.

            <h3>Reflection on the Writing Process</h3>
            
            <h4>The Challenge: Bridging the Gap</h4>
            <p>
              The most challenging aspect of writing this statement was connecting my very specific, high-tech experience (like Covisibility-Guided Sparse Attention) to the broader, earthier context of agriculture. I had to avoid sounding like a computer scientist who just wants a dataset to play with; instead, I needed to sound like a researcher interested in solving agricultural problems using computer science.
            </p>

            <h4>Rhetorical Strategies</h4>
            <p>
              To solve this, I relied on audience analysis, a concept we’ve discussed throughout the semester. I knew the selection committee would likely include both CS faculty and agricultural experts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concrete Evidence:</strong> I utilized specific terminology from the REU overview (e.g., Hyperspectral Imaging, Multimodal Large Language Models) to show I had read their specific research tracks.</li>
                <li><strong>Transferable Skills:</strong> I framed my 3D reconstruction research not just as a graphics project, but as preparation for Plant Phenotyping. This answered the so what? question—showing that my past work has a direct utility for their future goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying the Gap:</strong> I used the prompt’s question about what I don't have access to in my current program to create a persuasive argument for why this specific REU is necessary for my growth, rather than just asking for a job.</li>
            </ul>
