            <h3>Defining Technical Communication</h3>
            <p>
              If I were to explain technical communication to a colleague, I'd say it's the process of making complex
              information clear, concise, and easy for a specific audience to use. It’s not just about writing manuals;
              it's about creating any communication—be it an email, a presentation, or a webpage—that helps people
              understand a topic, complete a task, or make a decision. My background in computer science has shown me
              this firsthand. Explaining a software architecture to both project managers and other engineers requires
              tailoring the same core information for different audiences. This aligns with the chapter's definition,
              which describes technical communication as a set of activities people do to "discover, shape, and transmit
              information." It's the bridge between the expert and the person who needs to use that expert's knowledge.

            <h3>An Example of Effective Technical Communication</h3>
            <p>
              An excellent example of effective technical communication is the "Symptoms of a Heart Attack" infographic
              from the American Heart Association. As a former volunteer EMT, I saw how critical clear communication is
              in high-stakes situations. This infographic, while it may seem like a simple health poster, is a powerful
              piece of technical communication designed to convey vital information quickly and effectively when every
              second counts.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This infographic excels when measured against several of the "Measures of Excellence" mentioned in the
              chapter:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> It uses simple language ("Chest discomfort," "Shortness of breath") and
                clear icons. There's no jargon, which is crucial for a general audience with no medical training.</li>
              <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> In an emergency, no one has time to read a long document. This
                infographic presents the most vital information economically, getting the message across in seconds.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Usability:</strong> This is its strongest feature. The design is clean, the text is large, and
                the combination of words and images makes it highly accessible. It achieves its purpose—motivating a
                specific action (calling 911)—and meets the audience's needs in a critical moment.</li>
              <li><strong>Professional Appearance:</strong> The use of the American Heart Association's branding and a
                professional design lends it credibility, which makes the audience trust the information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Role of Technical Communication in My Future</h3>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I see technical communication playing a significant role in my career in computer science.
              The chapter's argument that employers highly value communication skills resonates with me. No matter how
              technical my work gets, I will always need to explain it to managers, team members, and clients who may
              not share my level of expertise. Being able to translate complex ideas into clear, actionable information
              will be essential for success. The principles of effective technical communication will be a constant in
              my professional life, and I believe my experiences as both a student of technology and a first responder
              have given me a unique appreciation for its importance. The chapter solidified my belief that strong
              communication isn't just a "soft skill" but a foundational and highly valuable professional tool.

            <h3>More Direction, Less Destination: Rethinking How I Set Goals</h3>
            <p>
              When listening to the podcast, something the host said just clicked. I know in the past I've definitely been guilty of setting "perfect" goals. The type that look great on paper (which is still specific, measurable, etc etc) but don't actually connect and are potentially too large for me too fulfill, and I got stuck. I was treating goal-setting like a to-do list instead of a tool for growth.

The idea that really stuck with me was making sure a goal is “directionally correct.” I don't need a perfect, five-year plan that predicts the future. I just need a pointer that helps me decide if an opportunity is a step in the right direction. It's a simple shift, but it's already helping me figure out ideas to filter out the noise and focus on what truly matters, which is becoming the kind of engineer and researcher I want to be.

For example, I've been thinking about trying to use this pointer to guide my big decisions. Instead of just grabbing any internship, I should intentionally pursue roles in both product engineering and AI research. I wanted to test my own assumptions and figure out where I felt most energized before going all-in. My goals shouldn't be finish lines, but instead should be questions that help me decide what to do next. Should I spend this semester polishing a research paper, or should I go deeper into applied engineering? Framing it this way helps me avoid chasing empty wins.

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>
              So, what does this look like in practice right now? My one big goal for this semester is....
              <b>Overhaul my job portfolio (résumé, project write-ups, and GitHub) to tell a clear story about my skills in both AI research and applied engineering. Then apply for at least 30 competitive internships for Summer 2026.</b>

            <h3>How I'm staying on Track</h3>
            <p>
              A goal without a plan is just a wish. To make this happen, I'm using a simple digital roadmap (a Trello board synced with my Google Calendar) to break the project into milestones.
<ul>
  <li>Revise résumé</li>
  <li>Curate & write up top projects (with metrics!)</li>
  <li>Draft research statement</li>
  <li>Schedule feedback sessions with mentors</li>
</ul>

Seeing it all mapped out keeps me focused and prevents the "where do I even start?" paralysis. I hope this will help me stay accountable and make steady, directionally correct progress.
